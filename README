DESCRIPTION
    This is a subclass of Pod::Weaver::Section::Collect that allows one to
    attach a prefix paragraph to the collected section/node.

ATTRIBUTES
  content *required*
    The intro paragraph. Right now this is expected to be a bog-simple
    string. Using POD or other bits will probably be supported down the
    road, but for now, it's just a string.

    This is wrapped in a Pod::Elemental::Element::Pod5::Ordinary and
    included after the section header but before any of the elements.
